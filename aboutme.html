          <p>
            I am a shop floor factory worker, hard labor is what I do. There
            comes a time in ones life when enough is enough, there is no
            opitunity to go up in the ranks (Nor will there ever be). There is
            no gratification at my work place, I am sure all my customers I
            bundle tubing for around Australia appriciate the work I do. I don't
            get any feed back.
            <br /><br />So near the end of 2019, I found this coding bootcamp
            course at Adelaide University. It provided me the tools to design
            web sites, as well as data bases which was really hard for me.
            Seeing as I have never done coding before and the very first time I
            saw the code, I knew I was out of my depth. This was during the
            prework activities pack given to all the students before the course
            started in Febuary 2020. Wow, I was so lost during to start of the
            course. But, I managed to get by some how.. <br /><br />I am a
            logical person and I knew that if I got stuck on something, I would
            be able to find a solution. Same thing applied when I was building
            my second drift car/street car. I never followed the pack, went my
            own way and built my car in a logical way. I only ever bought things
            for my car that had a function and servered the purpose that was
            needed. Just like coding, everything has a purpose and a function.
            Don't use things that serve no purpose. I hope this explains what
            type of person I am, last thing to add is that I am a very fussy
            person when creating and I will never be happy with a final product.
            But I will like it none the less..
